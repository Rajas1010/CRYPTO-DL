Abstract for this Project

1. **Importance of Secure Medical Image Sharing**:
   - Sharing medical images (like X-rays, MRI, and CT scans) safely is super important in healthcare.
   - These images have vital information for diagnosis, and sharing them quickly among doctors can help patients.

2. **Cybersecurity Challenges**:
   - But, when you send these images digitally, they can be vulnerable to cyber-attacks.
   - These attacks can breach patient privacy and confidentiality.

3. **Solution: Encryption**:
   - To fix this, we use a method called encryption. It's like a secret code for the images.
   - Encryption makes the image unreadable to anyone who shouldn't see it.

4. **Chinese Remainder Theorem**:
   - We also use something called the Chinese remainder theorem, which helps make the sharing even more secure.
   - It breaks the image into smaller pieces that can be sent more safely.

5. **Benefits of this Approach**:
   - This method helps doctors share images safely and quickly, leading to better patient care.
   - It ensures that patient privacy and confidentiality are always protected.

6. **Deep Learning in Medical Image Classification**:
   - We also talk about deep learning, which is like a smart computer program.
   - It's great at recognizing things in medical images, like tumors in X-rays, MRI, or CT scans.

7. **Tumor Detection with Deep Learning**:
   - Deep learning helps find different types of tumors, like in the brain, breast, or lungs, in medical images.

8. **Xception for Better Results**:
   - Xception is a special computer program for medical images.
   - It's super good at finding diseases and problems in MRI and CT scans.

9. **Why Xception Is Good**:
   - Xception is great because it's very accurate in finding issues in images.
   - It's also fast and doesn't need a lot of computer power, so even smaller hospitals can use it.

In short, this abstract is about making sure doctors can share important medical images safely, and also using smart computer programs to help find diseases in those images.
